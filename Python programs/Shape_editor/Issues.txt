** To Be Completed **

Proper exception handling:

    There is currently no exception handling in the program at any point.
    This must be implemented at all input points including creation of shapes where numbers are used for dimensions


Cone, Sphere and cyclinder creation functionality:

    At present there is logic for creating a cube but not for the other shapes.
    Exception handling must be considered here also


Proper formatiing:

    There are inconsistencies in the spacing between lines of code.
    There may also be inconsistencies in the 'new line' implementations where used in the program
